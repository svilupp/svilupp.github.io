AIMessage(&quot;# Theme 1: Traffic and Transportation Improvement
- Best illustrated by: &quot;Traffic is the main concern and needs to be addressed. Buses cause a major backup, they need to be allowed to pull over without backing up traffic even if the sidewalk needs to be pushed back in order to accommodate this, then it should be done. Many other cities do this.&quot;
- This theme is focused on the issues of traffic congestion, buses causing backups, and the need for improvement in transportation infrastructure.

# Theme 2: Affordable Housing
- Best illustrated by: &quot;More affordable housing or part of Austin primary Black and Hispanic will disappear.&quot;
- This theme highlights the need for more affordable housing options in Austin to prevent displacement and maintain the diversity of the community.

# Theme 3: Homelessness and Public Safety
- Best illustrated by: &quot;We have to do something about the homeless population. The homeless are downtown, under freeway passes, living in camps in the greenbelt, panhandling on every corner, all over UT Campus. Many seem to be on drugs and are unstable and aggressive. I don&#x27;t feel safe at night walking downtown alone.&quot;
- This theme addresses concerns about the homeless population, including safety issues and the need for proper support and intervention strategies.&quot;)</code></pre> <p>For a nicer display, I would recommend using Julia Markdown:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> Markdown

# Theme 2: Public Transportation Improvements
- Best illustrated by: &quot;WE NEED BETTER TRANSPORTATION. A LIGHT RAIL WOULD BE NICE.&quot;

# Theme 3: Affordable Housing and Cost of Living
- Best illustrated by: &quot;More affordable housing or part of Austin primary Black and Hispanic will disappear.&quot;

# Theme 4: Homelessness and Support Services

The homeless are downtown, under freeway passes, living in camps in the greenbelt, panhandling on every corner, all over UT Campus. Many seem to be on drugs and are unstable and aggressive.

# Theme 5: Environmental Sustainability and Clean Energy
- Best illustrated by: &quot;IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND A BIGGER PUSH FOR GREEN ENERGY AND GENERAL SERVICES&quot;

# Theme 6: Traffic and Non-Automotive Transportation Safety
- Best illustrated by: &quot;Please keep bicycles off roads that are too narrow and have no bike lanes. Impress upon bicycle riders that they are REQUIRED to follow the same laws as cars if they are driving in the street lanes - NO RUNNING RED LIGHTS. If bicycle riders don&#x27;t want cars to be rude to them, they need to ride appropriately.&quot;

# Theme 7: Green Spaces and Parks
- Best illustrated by: &quot;I would like to have a city park near my home with a walking trail. Poor neighborhoods rarely have a park nearby.&quot;

# Theme 8: Utilities and Energy
- Best illustrated by: &quot;The electric bill is too high, even with assistance program.&quot;

# Theme 9: Environmental Health and Safety
- Best illustrated by: &quot;Sanction those who blow leaves and trimmings into the street. Create ways to accelerate traffic flow on Lamar and Airport interception.&quot;

# Theme 10: Pollution Control and Waste Management
- Best illustrated by: &quot;THERE ARE MANY CRAZY PEOPLE WHO WANT FLUORIDE OUT OF THE DRINKING WATER HERE, PLEASE SEE PAST THE CRAZY AND REALIZE THERE ARE RATIONAL, LOGICAL AND FISCAL REASONS TO REMOVE FLUORIDE FROM THE WATER, IT IS REMOVED PEOPLE CAN STILL OPT-IN AND THE CITY CAN GET THEM FLUORIDE IN ANOTHER WAYS BUT IF IT REMAINS IN IT IS FORCED ON EVERYONE EVEN THOSE WHO DON&#x27;T WANT IT AND THOSE WITH MEDICAL CONDITION FLUOROSIS REMOVE FLUORIDE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY&quot;

<p>This way you can slice and dice your data in many ways, and GenAI will adapt to your needs.</p>
<h2 id=privacy_considerations ><a href="#privacy_considerations" class=header-anchor >Privacy Considerations</a></h2>
<p>First, OpenAI API does not use your training for training and it only retains for a short period of time to check for violations &#40;<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data">link</a>&#41;.</p>
<p>Second, you can use a few utilities we provide to scrub specific named entities &#40;see <code>?PT.replace_words</code>&#41;.</p>
<p>Third, PromptingTools.jl supports Ollama models, so you can switch over to local models without any changes to your code and your data never leaves your computer. If you need something quick and small, consider <code>openhermes2.5-mistral</code> or <code>zephyr</code>. If you have Apple M1 or Nvidia GPU, you can use something bigger like <code>yi:34b-chat</code>.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion ><a href="#conclusion" class=header-anchor >Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>By leveraging GenAI, we&#39;ve saved countless hours and gained a clear view of community opinions. This approach isn&#39;t just a time-saver; it&#39;s a game-changer in making data analysis more accessible and efficient. Join us next time for more GenAI-powered data solutions&#33;</p>
<p>Note: It does not mean that you should stop reading the verbatims completely&#33; GenAI helps you to get different perspectives very quickly to grasp the main themes and you can then follow up with more specific prompts/questions - or ask to receive only some specific verbatims &#40;eg, &quot;which verbatims mention emissions?&quot;&#41;</p>
