## Feeling Overwhelmed by Online Content? There's a GenAI Fix!

In today's digital age, keeping up with the constant stream of online content can feel like trying to drink from a firehose. So, what if I told you that you could scan a YouTube video for its key takeaways in just 30 seconds? Let's dive into how you can use Generative AI, specifically with Julia Language's `PromptingTools.jl` package, to achieve this.

## Practical Example: JuliaCon Video Analysis

Let's take a "not-so-random" video from this year's JuliaCon: [Julia-fying Your Data Team: the Ultimate Upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKuaKPy-gPo&ab_channel=TheJuliaProgrammingLanguage). Perhaps, you are curious about the content but unsure if it's worth your time. Here's how you can quickly find out:

**Step 1: Download the Transcript**
   - Go to the YouTube video
   - Below the video, click on the 'more' option to expand extra information
   - Scroll to Transcript section and click 'Show Transcript'
   - Copy the transcript (you can save it to a file or a variable, depending on its size)

**Step 2: Analyze with GenAI**
   - In Julia, use `PromptingTools.jl` and run the template `:AnalystChaptersInTranscript` on your transcript
   - In moments, you'll get a detailed chapter analysis

```julia
txt = read(open("youtube-juliafying-your-data-team.txt", "r")) |> String
# See the details: aitemplates("AnalystChaptersInTranscript")
msg = aigenerate(:AnalystChaptersInTranscript; transcript=txt, instructions="None.", model="gpt4t")
```

For a nicer display, I would recommend using Julia Markdown `Markdown.parse(msg.content)` or just copy it to a separate window in VSCode `clipboard(msg.content)`

All this in just a few seconds! 
Yeah, this video sounds interesting, I should probably watch it! üòÉ

## Practical Tip: Zoom out!

GenAI isn't just about quick analysis; it's about customization.

One of the best things is that it allows you to effortlessly increase or decrease the level of detail of a summary, similar to having zoom-in and zoom-out buttons but for the amount of information!

My favorite instruction when I want to quickly scan something is to say ‚ÄúMake it 5 words at maximum‚Äù or "Maximum 5 words per bullet point" and run it again:

```julia
msg = aigenerate(:AnalystChaptersInTranscript; transcript=txt, instructions="Maximum 2 bullet points per section or chapter. Maximum 5 words per bullet point.", model="gpt4t")
```
