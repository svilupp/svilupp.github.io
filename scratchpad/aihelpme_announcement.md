## Announcing AIHelpMe Pre-Release

Welcome to [AIHelpMe](https://github.com/svilupp/AIHelpMe.jl), a new Julia package that transforms your detailed docstrings into a rich source of insights. It's not about writing code for you; rather, it's about shining a light on the valuable documentation you and others have already created. Think of it as having a chat with your code's documentation, enhanced by AI's clever touch.

## Motivation and Value
Why write great docstrings? AIHelpMe gives you a compelling reason, turning them into an interactive, insightful guide. It's a subtle, yet powerful way to connect your queries with tailored, documentation-driven answers.

There are a few things that set this package apart from generic chatbots:

**Direct Access to Your Work**: AIHelpMe uniquely utilizes the latest information and modules directly from your laptop, ensuring up-to-date and relevant assistance.

**Full Control Over Searches**: Tailor your search scope and methods with AIHelpMe, aligning AI insights precisely with your needs.

**Contextual Understanding**: Go beyond typical chatbot responses; AIHelpMe offers deep insights, revealing the sources behind each answer, so you can continue your research ðŸ§ ðŸ“š

## Getting Started
Simply add AIHelpMe to your Julia environment (not registered yet) and get ready to interact with your code's documentation in a whole new way. Remember, API keys from Cohere and OpenAI are required, but the cost per query is just a tiny fraction of a cent.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/svilupp/AIHelpMe.jl")

using AIHelpMe # automatically some downloads pre-processed documentation

aihelp"How to create a named tuple from a dictionary?"
```

````plaintext
[ Info: Done generating response. Total cost: \$0.001
AIMessage("To create a named tuple from a dictionary, you can use the `NamedTuple` constructor and provide the dictionary's key-value pairs as arguments using the `name=value` syntax. Here's an example:

```julia
d = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
nt = NamedTuple(d)
```

In this example, the dictionary `d` is converted into a named tuple `nt` using the `NamedTuple` constructor. Each key-value pair in the dictionary becomes a named field in the named tuple.")
````

You can also ask GPT-4 Turbo to weigh in on your question (notice the "!" in `aihelp!"..."`) when you need deeper insights. For example, you can ask GPT-4 Turbo to explain the constructors for `NamedTuple`:

```julia
aihelp!"What other constructors does NamedTuple have?"gpt4t
```

[ Info: Tokens: 1023 @ Cost: \$0.0154 in 30.7 seconds
AIMessage("Aside from creating named tuples from pairs or a dictionary, `NamedTuple` offers other constructors as well:

1. **Tuple literal with keys**:
   ```julia
   nt = (a=1, b=2)
   ```

2. **Tuple literal with semicolon**:
   ```julia
   nt = (; a=1, b=2)
   ```

3. **Using `NamedTuple` type as constructor**:
   ```julia
   nt = NamedTuple{(:a, :b)}((1, 2))
   ```

4. **With specified types**:
   ```julia
   nt = NamedTuple{(:a, :b), Tuple{Int, Int}}((1, 2))
   ```

5. **From another named tuple or iterable**:
   You can create a new named tuple by splatting an existing named tuple or any iterable of pairs:
   ```julia
   existing_nt = (a=1, b=2)
   nt = NamedTuple((:c => 3, :d => 4, existing_nt...))
   ```

These constructors allow for flexibility in creating `NamedTuple`s programmatically or from existing data structures in Julia.")
