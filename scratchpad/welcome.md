# Welcome to my scratchpad!

TL;DR  This is a new blog site that I’m trying out and it’s simultaneously a lab: a way for me to test many new tools and technologies, a way to float my ideas, and, maybe, also get some feedback on them

## Backstory
Over the years, I have had countless ideas for blogs: reiterating ideas I have heard, expanding on them, synthesizing my learnings, or simply collating some great resources that I found in one place

Several of them I have worked out to a full outline (forever grateful for the [Pyramid principle by Barbara Minto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33206.The_Minto_Pyramid_Principle)), but I have published only a tiny fraction of them privately and **exactly zero publicly**.

## Root-cause Analysis
The three main reasons were:
- [Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome): There are so many amazing people already publishing their thoughts, what would I add to that? And related to it, the more I learned, the more I understood how little I know (see [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect))
- Future regret minimization: If I say something dumb today, it will be online forever and it will not reflect my evolved thinking
- Not perfect: I have very high standards and I am often unable to invest enough time to meet them when it comes to my side projects

## But, benefits?!
But I saw clear benefits:
- Too many packages, technologies, and services around the blogging and marketing industry that I won't be able to try otherwise, why not create a side project to explore them?
- Unless I write something down, I cannot expose its flaws and weaknesses (see [Leslie Lamport's interesting talk](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/leslie-lamport-thinking-code/))
- It's more effective for thoughts to be challenged by others, which cannot happen if I don't share them first
- But, most importantly, if at least 1 person finds an article helpful, I have created some impact and that is worth more than my bruised ego if it was not perfect

## So what has changed?
If I can formulate the challenges in the past, I can work around them.

Here is what I’ll do:
- aim for shorter articles, leaving the details, formulas, derivations, etc to others who are much more capable and just link to them
- publish "drafts" 2-3 iterations earlier than I would like and accept that I can evolve them over time or complete change it
- I wanted to play with :heartbeat: Franklin.jl :heartbeat: and the rest of the amazing Julia language ecosystem


If you have read this far, thank you!

Have you struggled with the same? How did you solve it? I would love to know (although I do need to set up the comments functionality, so bear with me...)
