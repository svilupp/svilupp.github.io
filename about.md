# About me

I'm Jan Siml and this is my personal website.

I'm currently Head of Data and Product Insight at [LexisNexis](https://lexisnexis.com/), but any opinions expressed on this site are my own.

# Interests
Arguably too many! I wish I could learn it all...

For the past few years, I've been interested in Bayesian and Causal Inference, because the world is an uncertain place ready to be intervened on!

In the past year, I've been exploring the Julia language and the more I know, the more I love it! You might read it about it here...

When I'm out of office, I love to chase the waves and the wind with my :kite: avoiding :shark::shark::shark:.

# Experience
Once a management consultant at McKinsey&Company, then an investor in African Private Equity Fund, then a corporate strategy manager, then a head of product analytics function, and, lastly, a lead of the data science team at LexisNexis.
