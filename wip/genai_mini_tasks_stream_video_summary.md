## Introduction

**Hey there, Julia enthusiasts and GenAI explorers!**

Ever found yourself in a pinch for missing a meeting or a webinar? Maybe it slipped your mind, or you skipped it for some Netflix bingeing (we don't judge!). But now you're scrambling to catch up without sitting through hours of recordings. Fear not! GenAI and PromptingTools.jl are here to rescue your day.

## How to turn "oops" into "ahh"

1. **Snag the Script**: Most webinars have a transcript. If not, a quick dive into the Chrome Inspector under the 'Network' tab will reveal the 'stream content'. Download it!

2. **Prep Your Text**: Use Julia to open a terminal, type `vim` and paste your script. Simple, right?

3. **Clean and Chunk**: Trim out the fluff from the script. Next, break it into chunks (say, every 40000 characters) separated by double newlines. This makes it more digestible for our AI buddy.

4. **Let GenAI Do Its Magic**: Send each chunk to GenAI asynchronously. No need for complex instructions yet.

5. **Merge and Marvel**: Once processed, stitch the summaries together. You can either display them directly or beautify them in Markdown format.

**And voil√†!** In about a minute, you have a concise, to-the-point summary of your missed meeting. You can now jump to the crucial parts if needed.

**But wait, there's more!**

For an even quicker scan, ask GenAI to limit each point to 5-7 words. It's like getting the 'trailer' of your meeting - quick, crisp, and clear.

**The best part?** This entire process takes less than 2 minutes and costs mere pennies, saving you a whopping 1.5 hours! That's a 45x benefit!

**Privacy Concern? No Problem!**

Handling a sensitive meeting? Switch to Ollama models for enhanced privacy. Plus, you can always scrub key entities before uploading, like this simple Julia `replace` code snippet.

## Conclusion
With all this saved time, maybe catch another episode of your favorite show? Or dive into another Julia project? The choice is yours!
