# Introduction
Have you spent a lot of time carefully avoiding clicking any click-bait-y articles to make sure you don't damage the perfectly curated Google Chrome link recommendations that you're getting right now? Or on Twitter?

Well, maybe that cat video you clicked on once is the reason why you never got to hear about Casual Inference podcast. This article should fix that.

Below are my go-to resources and people that I follow on regular basis.

## Podcasts
- epidemiology / Causal Inference
    - Serious EPI - Podcasts dedicated to causal inference methods. The second series goes through the Modern Epidemiology book chapter by chapter, so you can save yourself a 1000-pages-worth of reading
    - Casual Inference - Light hearted and very casual but still dedicated to Causal Inference methods (eg, there is an episode with Judea Pearl on personalized medicine)
    - Free associations - Journal club for public health topics. Excellent resource for anyone learning how to apply causal inference to real world problems
- bayesian stats
    - learning bayes stats - Great overview of all the different use cases of Bayesian stats across industries and academic disciplines. Produced by one of the core contributors of PyMC and a member of PyMC Labs
    - betancourting disaster - Interesting topics around Bayesian stats
    - dats n stats
- ML
    - twiml - Interesting news and stories from all around the ML scene
    - The world of DaaS - While it started focused on DaaS business, it has branched out recently
    - data sceptic (selective)
    - towards data science - Great podcast, especially the earlier episodes (like the interview of the medium.com data science team)
    - robot brains
    - deepmind the podcast
- Data-driven strategies, change managemwnt
    - avvo -
    - data chief
