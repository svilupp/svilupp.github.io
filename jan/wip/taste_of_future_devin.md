# A Taste of the Future: Programming with Devin

TL;DR: Devin isn't faster than coding on your laptop, but it's great for making code changes when you're away from your computer.

## The Experience

After 30+ hours of using Devin, I found it works best for specific tasks. While it's not faster than using tools like Cursor on my laptop, it's useful for making code changes while on the go. It handles Git operations well - I could tell it "restore that code from the diffs" and it just worked.

## What Works and What Doesn't

Devin is good at solving problems but sometimes makes them more complex than needed. It struggles with code organization - even when asked directly to reuse code, it often writes new functions instead.

## Watch Out For Code Drift

If you let Devin work without checking on it, it can lose track of your code's structure. When trying to fix test failures, it starts adding lots of IF statements and messy fixes. This gets hard to clean up later.

## Best Way to Use It

Devin works best when you:
- Check its work often
- Ask for updates on what it's doing
- Keep tasks small and focused

While it's not faster than writing code yourself, it lets you make useful changes when you're away from your computer - like fixing bugs in open source projects during your commute.

## What This Means

Devin shows what coding tools might look like in the future. Right now, it's most useful when you can't use your regular development setup but still want to get some work done.
