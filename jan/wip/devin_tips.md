# Tips for Working with Devin

After months of trial and error, I've discovered that success with Devin comes from understanding its workflow patterns and adapting your approach accordingly. Here are the key lessons learned.

## Essential Principles

1. **Progressive Development**
   - Start with small, contained tasks
   - Build complexity gradually
   - Verify each step before proceeding
   - Don't overwhelm with complex requirements upfront

2. **Clear Specifications**
   - Write specs separately in a notes app for easy formatting and reuse
   - Provide detailed docstrings with multiple examples
   - Define interfaces clearly to avoid over-complication
   - Consider using working snippets from other LLMs as starting points

3. **Active Monitoring**
   - Request frequent reflections and summaries
   - Watch for "drift" in implementation
   - Be ready to course-correct early
   - Don't hesitate to rollback when needed

## Code Management Tips

1. **Knowledge Management**
   - Avoid using knowledge snippets if possible
   - Be aware that old snippets can haunt refactoring
   - Disable auto-knowledge to prevent unwanted persistence
   - Manual disabling is tedious and should be avoided

2. **Code Quality**
   - Watch for dead code accumulation
   - Name specific code sections for removal
   - Review PR diffs frequently
   - Be explicit about code organization changes

3. **Problem Solving**
   - When facing multiple failures, request written hypotheses
   - Use reflection files for problem analysis
   - Consider parallel solution attempts
   - Keep track of working states for potential rollback

## Project Management

1. **Task Structure**
   - Break down complex tasks
   - Maintain clear priorities
   - Document success criteria
   - Keep specs separate and well-formatted

2. **Version Control**
   - Review PR updates frequently
   - Prefer diff view in PRs
   - Be cautious with test failures
   - Watch for unintended file submissions

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Verify CI results independently
   - Watch for test modifications
   - Keep test scope focused
   - Maintain clear test objectives

## Mobile Development

1. **Limitations**
   - GitHub workflow is challenging
   - Input can be tricky
   - UI navigation needs improvement
   - Progress tracking can be inconsistent

2. **Workarounds**
   - Use desktop for complex operations
   - Keep mobile tasks focused
   - Plan for interrupted sessions
   - Maintain clear documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Session Management**
   - Keep sessions focused and contained
   - Document progress regularly
   - Plan for context loss
   - Use explicit pause points

2. **Error Handling**
   - Document error patterns
   - Maintain solution history
   - Use systematic debugging
   - Keep error analysis separate

## Conclusion

Success with Devin comes from understanding its nature as a tool rather than a replacement. It's most effective when used with clear structure, active monitoring, and appropriate task sizing. While it may require significant oversight, the reduced cognitive load and flexibility it offers can make development more enjoyable and accessible.
