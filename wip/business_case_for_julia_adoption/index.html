With a modest learning time investment of 1-2 months in the Julia language, you can potentially cut your project completion time in half from 20 weeks to just 10 weeks. That&#39;s a return on investment worth considering.</p> <div class=franklin-toc ><ol><li><a href="#business_understanding">Business Understanding</a><li><a href="#data_understanding">Data Understanding</a><li><a href="#data_preparation">Data Preparation</a><li><a href="#modeling">Modeling</a><li><a href="#evaluationapplications">Evaluation/Applications</a><li><a href="#optimizing_deployment_with_julia">Optimizing Deployment with Julia</a></ol></div> <h1 id=introduction ><a href="#introduction" class=header-anchor >Introduction</a></h1> <p>At the recent JuliaCon 2023, I had the opportunity to share my thoughts &#40;link TBU&#41; on why Julia is a game-changer in the world of data science and business decision intelligence. My presentation was centered around three core tenets - Learn Faster, Build Faster, and Build Better - which encapsulate the potential of Julia to revolutionize the way we help businesses make data-driven decisions.</p> <p>However, due to time constraints, I wasn&#39;t able to delve into the tangible business case for adopting Julia or provide practical examples to demonstrate these advantages. This blog post seeks to fill that gap and, hopefully, will help you make a compelling case for Julia adoption in your organization.</p> <p>In the following sections, I will illustrate how Julia&#39;s strengths align with the stages of the CRISP-DM data science process model, providing some justification for the reduction in project timeline. By contextualizing the benefits of Julia within this widely-used framework, I hope to make the business case for Julia adoption compelling and clear. Let&#39;s delve into a deeper exploration of how Julia can enhance your decision intelligence projects.</p> <h1 id=crisp-dm ><a href="#crisp-dm" class=header-anchor >CRISP-DM</a></h1> <p>Before we delve into the advantages of Julia, let&#39;s briefly discuss the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining &#40;CRISP-DM&#41;, the framework that guides our data science journey. Introduced in 1999, CRISP-DM has emerged as a widely accepted methodology for data mining, analytics, and data science projects.</p> <p><img src="/assets/business_case_for_julia_adoption/CRISP-DM.png" alt="CRISP-DM Framework" /></p> <p>CRISP-DM is structured around six sequential phases:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Business Understanding:</strong> This phase involves understanding the business need. It helps define the problem and determine the project objectives from a business perspective.</p> <li><p><strong>Data Understanding:</strong> This phase is all about data exploration. It includes understanding what data is available, whether it&#39;s clean or requires cleansing, and determining if additional data is needed.</p> <li><p><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> This phase involves organizing the data for modeling. It usually includes activities like data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.</p> <li><p><strong>Modeling:</strong> This phase involves applying appropriate data modeling techniques to the prepared data. It includes the selection of potential models, their training, and tuning.</p> <li><p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> This phase involves assessing the models against the business objectives defined in the first phase. It helps decide which model best meets the business objectives.</p> <li><p><strong>Deployment:</strong> The final phase involves deploying the chosen model into a business environment. It includes making the results accessible to stakeholders and integrating the model with business processes for actionable insights.</p> </ul> <p>The CRISP-DM process is cyclical, often requiring a return to earlier stages as new insights or issues are uncovered. This iterative approach ensures more refined and impactful outcomes over time. In the next sections, we will explore how Julia can enhance each phase of this process, potentially speeding up the data science project timeline.</p> <h1 id=the_data_table ><a href="#the_data_table" class=header-anchor >The Data Table</a></h1> <table><tr><th align=right >Phase<th align=right >Timeline<th align=right >Power-Ups<tr><td align=right >Business understanding<td align=right >-<td align=right >Quarto&#43;Literate.jl<tr><td align=right >Data understanding<td align=right >2W -&gt; 1W<td align=right >Julia&#43;VSCode, ClipData, re-usable packages<tr><td align=right >Data preparation<td align=right >4W -&gt; 2W<td align=right >DataFramesMeta.jl &#40;macros&#33;&#41;, re-use previous work, types&#43;multiple dispatch<tr><td align=right >Modeling<td align=right >2W<td align=right >GLM.jl, MLJ.jl, Flux.jl, Turing.jl<tr><td align=right >Evaluation &#40;&#43;Application&#41;<td align=right >4W -&gt; 2W<td align=right >SHAP.jl, JuMP.jl, Optim.jl, Stipple.jl<tr><td align=right >Deployment<td align=right >8W -&gt; 3W<td align=right >Pkg.jl&#43;Test.jl, Profiler in VSCode, StructArrays.jl<tr><td align=right ><strong>Total</strong><td align=right >20W -&gt; 10W<td align=right >-</table> <h1 id=the_examples_and_comments ><a href="#the_examples_and_comments" class=header-anchor >The Examples and Comments</a></h1> <h2 id=business_understanding ><a href="#business_understanding" class=header-anchor >Business Understanding</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Time Reduction: NaN</p> <li><p>Notes: Quarto reports, writing text in Julia and converting into beautiful Quarto presentations thanks to Literate.jl</p> </ul> <p>In the initial Business Understanding phase of the CRISP-DM model, we focus on the problem definition, determining project objectives, and understanding the requirements from a business perspective. While this phase is not explicitly linked with any programming language, Julia provides certain advantages that aid in the comprehension of complex business problems.</p> <p>For instance, with Julia, you can quickly build interactive notebooks, or professional-looking reports using the combination of Quarto and <code>Literate.jl</code> straight from the code. These assets allow for the documentation of the business understanding phase in a format that&#39;s easy to share with all stakeholders. You can intersperse code, text, and visualizations in a single document, providing a clearer and more engaging explanation of your business understanding.</p> <p>This phase cuts across all stages of a project, making Julia&#39;s readability and accessibility key benefits in streamlining the overall process. The time savings here might not be as direct as in other phases but providing clear, understandable, and well-documented business understanding can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of subsequent stages.</p> <h2 id=data_understanding ><a href="#data_understanding" class=header-anchor >Data Understanding</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Time Reduction: From 2 weeks to 1 week</p> <li><p>Notes: ClipData for rapid iteration of data between VSCode and any other source &#40;Database clients, emails, Teams messages, ...&#41;, VS Code Julia Extensions &#43; <code>vscodedisplay&#40;&#41;</code>, StatsPlots.jl and DataFrameMeta.jl macros for EDA</p> </ul> <p>During the Data Understanding phase, we get familiar with the available data and ascertain its suitability and cleanliness for our project. The Julia and VS Code integration, alongside packages such as <code>ClipData</code>, make it possible for us to rapidly iterate over our data, leading to an in-depth understanding. For instance, using Julia&#39;s DataFrame capabilities in conjunction with VS Code&#39;s interactive environment, we can quickly perform exploratory data analysis &#40;EDA&#41;, visualize data distributions, and detect outliers. This fast and thorough exploration can reduce the timeline for this stage by half.</p> <h2 id=data_preparation ><a href="#data_preparation" class=header-anchor >Data Preparation</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Time Reduction: From 4 weeks to 2 weeks</p> <li><p>Notes: DataFramesMeta.jl macros for data transformation, re-use previous work &#40;eg, previous pipelines that are tested&#41;, types&#43;multiple dispatch</p> </ul> <p>Data Preparation is the stage where we cleanse, transform, and organize data for modeling. With Julia&#39;s package <code>DataFramesMeta.jl</code>, we can leverage macros to craft cleaner and more efficient data transformations. Take the example of joining multiple data sources or creating new derived features, <code>@chain</code> macro in <code>DataFramesMeta.jl</code> allows for easier-to-read and performant data manipulation. Coupled with Julia&#39;s emphasis on code reusability and multiple dispatch, the bespoke code we write in this phase can be repurposed in subsequent stages or future projects, significantly reducing the timeline.</p> <h2 id=modeling ><a href="#modeling" class=header-anchor >Modeling</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Time Reduction: NaN</p> <li><p>Notes: From the simple to deep networks, all very easy and integrated to the rest of code. SymbolicRegressions.jl is amazing for discovery &#40;and feature generation&#41;. The simplest linear regression doesn&#39;t even require any extra package - it&#39;s built-in in Julia&#33; Julia is built around arrays&#33;</p> </ul> <p>During the Modeling phase, we deploy various modeling techniques on our prepared data. Leveraging Julia packages such as <code>MLJ.jl</code> for machine learning, <code>Flux.jl</code> for deep learning, and <code>Turing.jl</code> for Bayesian inference, we can construct versatile and potent models. A practical example is using <code>MLJ.jl</code> which provides a uniform interface for calling models from various other packages. Although the timeline for this phase might remain the same, the enhanced comprehension and seamless environment that Julia offers will undoubtedly lead to better model development.</p> <h2 id=evaluationapplications ><a href="#evaluationapplications" class=header-anchor >Evaluation/Applications</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Time Reduction: From 4 weeks to 2 weeks</p> <li><p>Notes: Find out how to translate model outputs into optimal actions with Optim.jl and JuMP.jl, build interactive web apps with Stipple.jl - both to communicate the logic but also to run the experience with end-users, unwrap any black-box model with SHAP.jl</p> </ul> <p>The Evaluation phase entails determining which of our models best align with business objectives. Julia&#39;s extensive ecosystem, boasting packages like <code>SHAP.jl</code> for model interpretability, <code>JuMP.jl</code> for optimization, and <code>Stipple.jl</code> for creating interactive web apps, turns the evaluation phase into a smoother process. For example, using <code>SHAP.jl</code>, we can better understand &#40;non-linear&#33; pointwise&#33;&#41; feature effects in complex models and effectively communicate them to stakeholders. The power of these tools can lead to a reduction in the timeline from 4 weeks to just 2.</p> <h2 id=optimizing_deployment_with_julia ><a href="#optimizing_deployment_with_julia" class=header-anchor >Optimizing Deployment with Julia</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Time Reduction: From 8 weeks to 3 weeks</p> <li><p>Notes: Very little code to change&#33; Tests built up as the project is built and all is automatically ran in CI on every push to the code repository. Pkg.jl allows easy reproducibility. VSCode Profiler quickly highlights bottlenecks, but performance rarely requires any attention - it&#39;s more than sufficient out of the box.</p> </ul> <p>The final phase, Deployment, involves making our models available to stakeholders. With Julia&#39;s <code>Pkg.jl</code> and <code>Test.jl</code> for package management and testing, and the Profiler in VSCode for identifying bottlenecks, we can optimize this phase from 8 weeks to just 3. For instance, using <code>Pkg.jl</code> we can effectively manage dependencies, create reproducible environments, and ensure that our models run reliably when deployed.</p> <p>In sum, adopting Julia can lead to a potential reduction in the project completion time from 20 weeks to just 10 weeks. Every stage of the CRISP-DM process reaps the benefits of Julia&#39;s flexibility, efficiency, and interoperability. Embracing Julia in your data science projects can significantly accelerate delivery timelines and produce impactful results faster.</p> <h1 id=conclusion ><a href="#conclusion" class=header-anchor >Conclusion</a></h1> <p>In conclusion, the adoption of Julia in your data science workflow presents a substantial opportunity to reduce project completion time, improve understanding, and deliver more effective results. Although the learning curve may seem steep initially, the long-term benefits are unquestionable, as demonstrated in this blog post. By investing the time to learn Julia, you&#39;re not just adding another tool to your data science toolkit, but you&#39;re embarking on a journey that will redefine your data science practices for the better. So give Julia a shot, and let it empower you to learn faster, build faster, and build better&#33;</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Jan Siml.
