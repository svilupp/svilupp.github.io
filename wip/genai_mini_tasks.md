# THIS IS AN UNFINISHED DRAFT

# TL;DR
This blog highlights how Generative AI can be a time-saving asset for Julia programmers, offering an economical way to 'buy' time by efficiently handling everyday mini-tasks and minimizing distractions.

## Welcome to the Future of Programming!

Hello, Julia enthusiasts! We're kicking off an exciting new blog series exploring how Generative AI, especially through PromptingTools.jl, can revolutionize your coding experience. Imagine turning the mundane, time-consuming tasks into a breeze. That's what we're here to uncover!

## **The Magic of Mini-Tasks**

Mini-tasks: those pesky, everyday chores like reformatting text, tidying up messy files, or coding a utility function for data plotting. They're necessary, yet often distract us from our main goals. What if we could delegate these to a smart, efficient helper?

## **Why Delegate to AI?**

**Economically Sensible:** Save those precious minutes for just a few cents. It's not just about saving time; it's about investing it wisely.

**Cognitive Load:** Every time you pause your main task to tackle a side chore, you're draining mental energy. Generative AI steps in to take that load off your shoulders, allowing you to focus on what truly matters.

**Learn As You Go:** Engaging with AI tools is a fantastic way to understand their capabilities and limitations, fine-tuning your approach to get the best results.

## **The Hidden Cost of Distractions**

Research shows that context switching is more costly than we realize. Each interruption can set you back 23-25 minutes in regaining focus. The cognitive toll of switching between tasks can’t be ignored, often leading us down unproductive paths.

## **Real-World Example: String Manipulation**

Consider a simple string manipulation task in Julia. Changing currency pair formats seems straightforward, but it's trickier than it appears. By using Generative AI, I completed this task in just 20 seconds for mere cents. When I tried coding it manually, it unexpectedly took almost 10 minutes! That’s 8 minutes saved and a whole lot of mental energy conserved for the real challenges.

TODO: Add the example and exact stats!

## **Embracing AI in Your Workflow**

So, there you have it! Generative AI isn't just a tool; it's a productivity partner. Stay tuned for more insights and use cases in our upcoming posts. Dive into the world of AI-powered programming and experience the difference in your Julia projects!
